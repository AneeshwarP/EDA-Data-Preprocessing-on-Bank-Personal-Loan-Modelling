# EDA-Data-Preprocessing-on-Bank-Personal-Loan-Modelling

Welcome to my data analysis repository! This collection of projects showcases my skills in data exploration, machine learning, and data visualization.

Project Overview:
This project's core objective is to leverage data analysis and machine learning to optimize Thera Bank's marketing efforts, increasing campaign success rates while reducing costs.

What You'll Find:

Data Exploration: Dive into exploratory data analysis (EDA) of various datasets, where I uncover hidden patterns, trends, and anomalies, using a combination of statistical analysis and data visualization.

Machine Learning: Explore projects where I apply machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems, from predictive modeling to classification and clustering tasks.

Data Visualization: Witness the power of data visualization in conveying complex information through captivating charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards.

Statistical Analysis: Discover in-depth statistical analyses that provide valuable insights and inform data-driven decisions.

Data Cleaning: Learn about the crucial process of data preprocessing and cleaning, where I transform messy datasets into structured, usable information.

Conclusion:
This project aims to empower Thera Bank's Retail Marketing Department with a powerful predictive model that can identify potential personal loan customers among the existing liability customer base. By achieving this, the bank anticipates an increase in campaign success rates and cost savings, ultimately contributing to the bank's growth and profitability.
